Errr... Errors?

Yup, Errors is a simple app that was initially designed to
allow testing of front-end ajax calls against error responses,
to be sure all error cases are treated and rendered correctly.

It's a dead simple tool, and you can also test success HTTP
codes and other redirects, but the name stayed!
